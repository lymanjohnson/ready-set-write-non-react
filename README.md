# Ready Set Write
## A light rite to aright bright writers to write right now

Ready Set Write is a daily gamified writing workshop-style exercise to help aspiring and hobby writers brainstorm and create a one-page story fast. It helps break writer's block by encouraging you to write right now!

It's not a how-to or a style class, but rather a simple, active way to encourage short spurts of rapid ideation and stream of conscious writing. By keeping you typing, and rewarding quantity over quality, it helps cautious or stalled writers unclog their creative juices and just get something on the page already!
