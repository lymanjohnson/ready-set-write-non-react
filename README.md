# Ready Set Write
## A light rite to aright bright writers to write right now


Ready Set Write is a daily gamified writing workshop-style exercise to help aspiring and hobby writers brainstorm and create a one-page story fast. It helps break writer's block by encouraging you to write right now!


It's not a how-to or a style class, but rather a simple, active way to encourage short spurts of rapid ideation and stream of conscious writing. By keeping you typing, and rewarding quantity over quality, it helps cautious or stalled writers unclog their creative juices and just get something on the page already!


## How It Works


### Stage 0 - The Prompt

Each session starts out with a prompt. It will usually be a sentence or short paragraph, but may also include pictures or sounds. Examples might include:

"The thing he is good at is very, very bad."

"Use all of the following words in a piece of writing: bit, draw, flex, perilous, bubble, corner, rancid, pound, high, open."

"Write a story about what you think is happening in this picture"

### Stage 1 - Story Elements

The writer will be presented with five blank cards. The cards will have different flavors, corresponding to different story elements. The flavors include:

  1. Characters
  2. Locations
  3. Objects
  4. Groups/Organizations
  5. Past Events

A writer might be presented with two blank character cards, a location card, and an object card. If they were going to write a gritty detective noire thriller they might fill out the character cards with "Hard-boiled detective" and "Lady in a red dress", the location card with "A cheap downtown office", and the object with "a loaded gun". These are the physical Nouns, so to speak, that will play a major role in their story.

### Stage 2 - Traits

The writer will now go through each of the cards they filled out and come up with a handful of traits for each one. Like the story element cards from stage 1, each of these traits will have a flavor, as well. Trait flavors for a character might include:

1. Strengths
2. Weaknesses
3. Fears
4. Regrets
5. Desires

Trait flavors for an object might include:

1. Who created it
2. How old it is
3. Weight
4. Smell
5. Material

When presented with "Hard-boiled detective" the writer might be asked to describe two strengths, one weakness, and a regret. The writer might then write "A damn good shot" and "holds his whiskey" as his strengths, "short-tempered" as his weakness, and "failing to save his buddy in the war" as his regret.

### Stage 3 - relationships

Now the writer will be presented with a pair of the cards she wrote, and asked to describe the relationship between the two elements. For example, when presented with "The Detective" and "The Gun" cards, she might write

"An officer's pistol from his time in the war. Frankly it's too heavy and the aim is crooked, but he's used to it enough that it would be worse for him to change it now. He keeps it well-oiled, and and well-hidden."

She will need to do this for every pairing of cards.


### Stage 4 - Write!

The writer has now been presented with a writing prompt and forced to write a fair bit about the basic building blocks of the story. The final stage is now to just write a full page of story about the things she's been thinking of.


### Wrap Up

Each section of the game is timed, and she'll be scored on how many cards or traits she filled out in the time limit, how well she filled out the one-page story quota at the end, her day-to-day consistency and dedication, and even her average words per minute.

Badges and rewards can be presented for special achievements and consistent results.
